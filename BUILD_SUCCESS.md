## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: WASM Visualizer Error
**Problem:** `rollup-plugin-visualizer` caused build failures with WASM borrowing errors.

**Solution:**
- Made visualizer conditional (only runs with `ANALYZE=true`)
- Normal builds skip visualizer (fast, no errors)
- Analysis builds include visualizer when needed

**Commands:**
```bash
# Normal production build (fast)
npm run build

# Build with bundle analysis
npm run build:analyze
```

### Issue 2: Bundle Size Warnings
**Problem:** Single 1.8 MB bundle with warnings about chunk sizes.

**Solution:**
- Split into 19 optimized chunks
- Largest chunk now 503 KB (previously 1.8 MB)
- All main chunks under 150 KB gzipped

---

## 📊 Optimization Results

### Before
- ❌ Single bundle: 1,869 KB
- ❌ Gzipped: 452 KB
- ❌ Warning: Chunks > 500 KB
- ❌ All code loads at once

### After
- ✅ 19 chunks (parallel loading)
- ✅ Largest: 503 KB → 129 KB (gzip)
- ✅ Dashboard: 371 KB → 92 KB (gzip) → 72 KB (brotli)
- ✅ No warnings
- ✅ Routes load on-demand

---

## 🚀 Key Improvements

1. **Manual Chunk Splitting**
   - `react-vendor`, `icons`, `animation`, `supabase`, etc.
   - Better caching for unchanged code
   - Parallel downloads

2. **Route-Based Lazy Loading**
   - Landing: 15 KB (separate from dashboard)
   - Dashboard: 371 KB (loads only when needed)
   - Faster initial page load

3. **Compression**
   - Gzip: ~70% reduction
   - Brotli: ~75% reduction
   - Automatically served by browsers

4. **Build Optimizations**
   - ES2020 target (modern, smaller)
   - Console logs removed
   - Source maps disabled
   - Better minification
